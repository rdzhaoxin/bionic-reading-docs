Bold the first part of each word in English, and the reading speed may be greatly improved.

People don't actually read text word by word in order. When we read a paragraph, we will pick key sentences, when we read a sentence, we will pick key words, and when we read a character, we may only scan the radicals. After long-term reading training, for the sake of efficiency, the human eye will automatically select the key parts to read. Bionic guides the point of eye positioning through the method of key marks, saving the time for the eyes to filter information, so that it can be used to speed up reading and focus on important information.

### Tip
You can modify the Main weight and Bold weight to adjust the bold part through Editor -> Font -> Typography Settings
